# Super Simple Vimeo API Example
This is a very simple example showing how to access the Vimeo third-party player link via the Vimeo API using PHP and cURL. This approach is [approved](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/authentication#authenticated-requests) by Vimeo for single user apps that will be run server side. For more complex use cases, see the Vimeo API libraries: https://developer.vimeo.com/api/libraries. The API playground is a great place to do some testing: https://developer.vimeo.com/api/playground/.
